# Create hosts and playbook.yml in controller machine
1. Navigate to e:\vagrantprojects\ansibledemo\ansible-controller directory in windows 10 and run the following commands.
```sh
  vagrant up
  vagrant ssh
  $mkdir ansible-project
  $cd ansible-project
  $touch hosts
  $touch playbook.yml
```

2. Using vi editor, edit hosts file and add the following lines.
```sh
  [webservers]
  192.168.33.10

  [dbservers]
  192.168.33.11
```

3. Run the ping command to test connection to host machines by running following commands. Ensure you are in ansible-project directory (use $cd ansible-project)
```sh
  $ansible all -m ping -i hosts
```

4. Now edit playbook.yml and following instructions. If format of the content is not proper, you can use "yaml formatter online" from google search.
```sh
  ---
- name: Install HTTPD using Ansible Playbook
  hosts: webservers #here ensure that node instance name is correct or not 
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install HTTPD package
      package:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    - name: Start HTTPD service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

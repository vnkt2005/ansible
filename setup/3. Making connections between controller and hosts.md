# Making connection between controller and host machines. 

1. Make sure all machines are up and running. Run command
   ```sh
   $ip addr
   ```
   on each machine and check they have  IP addresses in the same range (e.g. 192.168.33.x)
   
2. Navigate to ansible-controller folder and run the following commands.
   ```sh
      vagrant ssh
      $ssh-keygen
   ```

3. Goto ~/.ssh directory and check the private and public keys generated.

4. Copy the public key to the host machines by using the command.
   ```sh
      $ssh-copy-id vagrant@192.168.33.10
      $ssh-copy-id vagrant@192.168.33.11
   ```

5. If the above command does not work, try the manual method of copying the contents of the .pub file generated by ssh-keygen command and pasting it into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the host machines from the controller machine.

6. Connect to the host machines using following commands
   ```sh
      $ssh vagrant@192.168.33.10
      $ssh vagrant@192.168.33.11
   ```
